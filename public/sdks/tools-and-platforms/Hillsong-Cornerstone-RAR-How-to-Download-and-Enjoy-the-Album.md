The song also reminds us that God's love is unchanging and His grace is sufficient in times of trouble.
 
Another song that stands out in the album is "I Surrender", which expresses a heartfelt desire to surrender everything to God and follow His will. The song features a powerful chorus that invites the listeners to join in the worship: "I surrender, I surrender / I want to know You more, I want to know You more".
